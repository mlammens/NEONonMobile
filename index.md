This is the website for the NEON-on-Mobile project created by Matthew E. Aiello-Lammens ([https://ecologistatwork.com](https://ecologistatwork.com)) as part of the NEON Spring 2020 Faculty Mentoring Network.
The idea for this project originated in response to teaching challenges associated with moving to fully remote online learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
During this time, many educators found that their students were only able to work online using a mobile device. 
The goal here is to provide a means to learn basic data science skills using NEON data on a mobile device.

* [Main Module](pages/working-with-neon.html) - this page is the primary module that students / learners can use to learn basic data science skills.
